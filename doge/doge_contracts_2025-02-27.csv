This issue has resulted in multiple calls to the building contracted cleaners and carpet companies more often than wanted. We have put in place a comprehensive proactive carpet cleaning plan to ensure the spaces are kept in the upmost conditions. While funding requests for
carpet cleaning increased, the carpet's appearance and odor(s) have not improved with these standard periodic spot cleanings. There have been several walk-throughs conducted to identify and confirm that a more extensive cleaning program is necessary to help prevent mold and mildew growth, remove deep-seated pollutants, restore the appearance of carpets, and possibly extend the life of the carpet, therefore decreasing long-term expenses. Approval is requested to have the RRB carpet steam cleaned bi-annually (twice a year) to improve appearance and remove odors.",0
